name: localize
description: Native-quality Android string localization. Discover LanguageDataSource.kt, ask language and complete/missing MCQs, then translate in parallel — one agent per language writing only that locale's values-* folder. Use when the user says localize, translate strings, add locale strings.xml, missing translations, or native localization.
---

# Localize

You are the **coordinator**. Discover languages, ask the two required questions, snapshot resources, then dispatch **one worker per language in a single parallel batch**. You do not translate when 2+ target locales are selected. Workers write disjoint paths so parallel mutation is safe.

Do not write any localization file until both MCQs are answered.

---

## 0. Hard rules

1. Search `LanguageDataSource.kt` first. Do not invent languages.
2. Native translation (meaning + UI context), not word-for-word.
3. One worker = one language. Launch **all** workers in **one** parallel turn. Never wait for language 1 before starting language 2.
4. Each worker writes **only** `**/res/values-<qual>/**` for its locale. Two workers must never touch the same file.
5. Preserve resource `name` keys, placeholders, formatting, XML validity, section comment order.
6. Do not change `LanguageDataSource.kt`, Gradle, architecture, or extract hardcoded Kotlin/Compose strings unless the user explicitly asks.
7. Never delete resources. Never rename keys. Never remove an existing translation just because it differs from the source.

---

## 1. Discover `LanguageDataSource.kt`

Search the whole project for the file `LanguageDataSource.kt` (filename match — do not search for an annotation named LanguageDataSource). Open that file and read the class plus nearby enums, sealed classes, lists, constants, or objects that hold language codes.

Examples of shapes (do **not** assume these are the project):

```kotlin
class LanguageDataSource {
    val languages = listOf("en", "ur", "es")
}
```

```kotlin
enum class Language(val code: String)
```

```kotlin
object SupportedLanguages {
    const val ENGLISH = "en"
    const val URDU = "ur"
}
```

Use the project's actual source of truth.

### Not found

Ask exactly this, then wait:

```text
I couldn't find LanguageDataSource.kt in the project.

Please either:
A. Add/restore LanguageDataSource.kt, or
B. Provide the language code(s) manually.
```

If the user chooses B, continue with those codes. Do not guess.

---

## 2. Language MCQ (mandatory — wait)

Show the detected codes numbered, then ask exactly:

```text
I found these language codes in LanguageDataSource.kt:

1. en
2. ur
3. es
4. ms

Which languages should I localize?

A. All detected languages
B. Select specific languages
C. Other — enter language code(s)
```

Replace the numbered list with the real codes. The user must choose.

- **B** → ask for the codes, then continue.
- **C** → accept any codes (`ur`, `fr-CA`, `pt-BR`, `zh-CN`, …). Do not reject a code because it was not in `LanguageDataSource.kt`. Explicitly say it is outside the discovered language source.

Do not infer languages. Do not start work.

---

## 3. Scope MCQ (mandatory — wait)

After languages are confirmed, ask exactly:

```text
What should I localize?

A. Localize completely
   Translate all applicable strings/resources for the selected languages.

B. Localize only missing
   Translate only strings/files that are currently missing for the selected languages.
```

Do not modify files until the user chooses A or B.

| Mode | Worker does |
|------|-------------|
| **A complete** | Translate every assigned translatable resource. Improve existing strings that are clearly wrong, unnatural, inconsistent with project terminology, or broken (placeholders/XML). Keep wording that is clearly intentional/custom. |
| **B missing-only** | Add missing files and missing keys only. Do not rewrite existing translations unless XML is invalid. |

---

## 4. Snapshot (coordinator, no writes)

Do this once, fast, before any worker starts.

1. **Source locale** = the project's default `res/values/` (usually `:core-ui` `values/strings.xml`). Do not assume English just because the text looks English. Inspect project config and existing folders.
2. **Folder map** — use existing project convention; do not blindly transform codes:
   - `ur` → `values-ur/`
   - `fr-CA` → `values-fr-rCA/`
   - `pt-BR` → `values-pt-rBR/`
   - `zh-CN` → `values-zh-rCN/`
   If mapping is ambiguous, ask. Do not guess.
3. **Skip the source locale** (e.g. `en` when source is `values/`). Say you skipped it.
4. Collect translatable `<string>`, `<string-array>`, `<plurals>`. Skip `translatable="false"`. Keep section comments (App → General → `cd_*` → screens) so workers can mirror order.
5. For each target language, compute missing keys, existing keys, and whether the locale file/folder must be created.
6. Build one **work pack per language** (this is what makes workers accurate and fast — they must not rediscover the app):

```text
languageCode:
androidFolder:          # e.g. values-ur
outputFiles:            # exact paths this worker may write
mode: complete | missing-only
sourceKeys:             # name → source value + type (string|array|plurals) + placeholders
assignedKeys:           # complete = all translatable; missing-only = missing only
existingTranslations:   # this locale only
terminologyHints:       # recurring terms from other locales (read-only)
doNotTranslate:         # product/brand/API names already used as-is
```

---

## 5. Parallel dispatch — one agent per language

### Speed (mandatory)

If **2 or more** target languages:

- Launch **one independent worker per language in a single parallel batch**.
- Coordinator does **not** translate.
- Do not serialize. Do not put two languages in one agent.
- If a worker fails, re-launch **only that language**. Do not redo finished locales.

If **exactly 1** target language: coordinator may translate directly (spawn overhead is wasted).

This parallel mutation is **explicitly requested** and **safe**: workers write disjoint directories.

### Host (Android Studio Agent)

Invoke with `@localize`. Spawn one parallel worker per language; each writes only that locale's `values-*` folder.

If the host cannot spawn subagents: still isolate by language (one locale's files per write pass). Never mix locales in one write.

### Worker prompt (paste verbatim, then append that language's work pack)

```text
You are a native localizer for ONE language only.

LANGUAGE=<code>
FOLDER=<values-xx>          # Android resource folder qualifier
OUTPUT=<exact file paths>
MODE=complete | missing-only

WRITE ONLY the OUTPUT paths under FOLDER. Do not touch any other locale, Kotlin, Gradle, or LanguageDataSource.kt.

Translate as a native product writer for LANGUAGE. Meaning + UI context, not word-for-word.

Must:
- Keep every resource `name` key unchanged.
- Preserve placeholders exactly (%s %d %f %1$s %2$d %% …). Same set and numbering.
- Preserve \n \t HTML/CDATA and required XML escaping (& < > ' ").
- Valid Android XML. No duplicate names. Close every tag.
- Plurals: use this locale's quantity categories (do not copy English one/other blindly).
- Mirror source section comment order.
- Skip translatable="false".
- Do not translate product/brand/API/library names, URLs, emails, package names, or code identifiers unless existing translations in this project already do.
- Complete mode: fill all assigned keys; fix clearly wrong/unnatural/broken existing strings; keep intentional custom wording.
- Missing-only: add missing keys/files only; do not rewrite existing translations.
- Do not delete keys. Do not rename keys. Do not extract hardcoded strings.

If a string is still ambiguous after the key + surrounding strings, leave a note; do not invent context.

Before you return, verify every assigned key: placeholders match, XML is valid, translation sounds native.

Return only:
{
  "language": "<code>",
  "filesCreated": [],
  "filesModified": [],
  "translatedCount": 0,
  "skippedExisting": 0,
  "remainingMissing": 0,
  "placeholderIssues": 0,
  "xmlIssues": 0,
  "notes": []
}
```

---

## 6. Merge + verify (coordinator, after every worker returns)

1. Confirm every selected language produced a result.
2. Re-diff canonical source vs each locale. Remaining missing must be 0 in complete mode (except `translatable="false"` / source-locale skip).
3. Spot-check placeholders on a sample of formatted strings (`%1$s`, plurals).
4. If a worker left `placeholderIssues` or `xmlIssues` > 0, fix that locale (re-launch that worker) before reporting success.
5. Run a real project validation if cheap (`./gradlew lint` or the module that owns `strings.xml`). Do not invent a Gradle task. If you cannot run it, say so.
6. If you noticed hardcoded user-facing strings in Kotlin/Compose, **report them only** — do not extract.

---

## 7. Final report (always)

```text
Localization complete

Languages:
- ur
- es

Mode:
- Complete localization | Missing-only

Results:
- Files created: N
- Files modified: N
- Strings translated: N
- Strings remaining: N
- Placeholder issues: N
- XML/resource issues: N

Validation:
- Android resource validation: passed/failed
- Build/lint: passed/not run/failed

Notes:
- ...
```

For missing-only, explicitly say whether any missing resources remain.

---

## 8. Translation law (workers)

**Write as a native speaker of the target language**, as if the app was originally authored in that language.

- Use the key, surrounding strings, comments, and UI role (button, title, error, dialog, notification, `cd_*`) to choose phrasing.
- Prefer concise UI wording. Match source tone (not more formal unless the source is).
- One term per product concept (`Settings`, `Sign in`, `Retry`, …) across the whole locale. Reuse this project's existing good translations as the glossary.
- Respect locale punctuation, typography, and capitalization.
- Do not copy English word order. Do not add or drop meaning. Do not leave accidental English where a translation is required.

Do not translate: product names, company/brand names, API/library/framework names, programming language names, identifiers, URLs, emails, package names, file names — unless this project's existing locales already translate that token.

---

## 9. Ambiguity and structural changes

- Ambiguous string (`open`, `delete`, …): infer from key + nearby resources first. If it would materially change the translation, note it or ask — do not invent.
- If a structural change seems needed (move files, split resources, rename keys), stop and ask. Do not do it as part of localize.

---

## 10. Out of scope (stop and ask)

Redesigning UI, extracting hardcoded strings, changing architecture, Gradle, locale-detection logic, or `LanguageDataSource.kt`.
